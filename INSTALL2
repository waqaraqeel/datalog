The bundled lua has been removed. Lua is now an external dependency.

Please install lua 5.3 using your package manager.
Also install Automake 1.16 and Libtool.
Then run:
    ./configure CPPFLAGS=-I<lua-include> --with-lua

where <lua-include> is the lua include path (e.g. /usr/local/include/lua).

After that, the usual "make" and "sudo make install" should work.
